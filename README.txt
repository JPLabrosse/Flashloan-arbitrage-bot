//Project Overview//

The UBI project aims to develop an innovative application that leverages cryptocurrency
arbitrage and predictive investing to generate a universal guaranteed income for users. This 
income is not funded by governmental or state sources but is sustained through the strategic 
utilization of cryptocurrency market opportunities.

//Core Components of the Project//

1. Arbitrage Trading Bot
-Executes trades across different exchanges to capitalize on price discrepancies.
-Increases users' balances automatically through profitable trades.

2. Predictive Investment Bot
-Takes over the balance from the arbitrage bot.
-Reinvests it using sophisticated algorithms to maximize returns.

3. Staking Mechanism
-Users are required to stake a significant portion of their earnings:
	-80% in the first year.
	-60% in the second year.
	-30% in the third year.
-This mechanism ensures sustained investment and growth of the funds.

4.Withdrawal Limits
-Users can only withdraw a portion of their earnings.
-This policy is designed to maintain a stable investment pool and encourage long-term wealth 
 accumulation.

//App Structure//

1.UI/UX Design
-Focuses on user-friendly design to facilitate easy management and viewing of investments.
-Features a dashboard for real-time tracking of balances and transactions.

2.Frontend Development
-Implements the designs using modern web technologies to ensure responsiveness and interactive 
user experience.

3.Backend Development
-Manages data, user interactions, and integrates with the blockchain for transaction handling.
-Ensures secure and efficient processing of all operations within the app.

4.Security
-Employs robust security measures to protect user data and transaction integrity.
-Regular updates and audits to safeguard against evolving cyber threats.
